            obtain your 80G receipt: <br /> 1. Log in to your account using the

            <br /> 2. Go to your ‘Profile’ section. <br />

            <br /> 5. If required, fill out any additional forms.
            <br /> 6. Submit the form, and your 80G certificate will be
            instantly available for download.
            <br /> Notably, instead of receiving separate 80G certificates for
            each donation, you’ll receive a consolidated certificate via email
            covering all your donations made through our platform during the
            financial year. Additionally, the corresponding 10BE form, which
            proves your eligibility for tax deduction, will also be

            1. <b>Donor Notification</b>: Donors are informed about the
            patient’s demise and the non-transfer of funds.
            <br /> 2. <b>Confirmation Process</b>: The patient’s family and
            hospital confirm whether there are any pending bills related to the
            treatment. <br />
            3. <b>Options for Donors</b>: If no bills are outstanding, donors
            are notified of the available funds. <br />
            They can choose to re-route the donation to another patient or
            request a refund. If donors prefer, the donation can be directed to
            the original patient’s family or next-of-kin. We aim to handle such
