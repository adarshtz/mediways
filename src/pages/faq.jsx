            Only donations made to fundraisers that are set up by legally
            registered non-profits (NGOs) or charities may be considered
            eligible for donors to claim as a tax deduction. Look for a note
            '80G tax benefits for INR donations' below the 'Donate Now' button
            on the fundraiser. You can also filter for fundraisers with tax
            benefits on the listing page here. Aidcircle is not an NGO and is
            only a custodian of funds; hence, it cannot provide tax exemption.
            If you have donated to a fundraiser that provides tax exemption, you
            can download the tax receipt from your dashboard. To do so, you will
            have to log in to your Aidcircle account using your email ID or
            registered mobile number and then visit your dashboard to download
            tax receipts.

            When a patient, for whom funds were being raised, unfortunately
            passes away before treatment begins and no funds have been
            transferred yet, Milaap follows this protocol: <br />
            1. <b>Donor Notification</b>: Donors are informed about the
            patient’s demise and the non-transfer of funds.
            <br /> 2. <b>Confirmation Process</b>: The patient’s family and
            hospital confirm whether there are any pending bills related to the
            treatment. <br />
            3. <b>Options for Donors</b>: If no bills are outstanding, donors
            are notified of the available funds. <br />
            They can choose to re-route the donation to another patient or
            request a refund. If donors prefer, the donation can be directed to
            the original patient’s family or next-of-kin. We aim to handle such
            situations with sensitivity and transparency. If you have any
